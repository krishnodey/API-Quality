GET 	 /devices/cameras/device_id/activity_zones 	 Returns an array of all defined Activity Zones. Activity Zones are used to monitor motion events within user-defined areas of the video stream. Requires Nest Aware. 	 0 	 1 	
GET 	 /devices/cameras/device_id/snapshot_url 	 Capture an image on demand. Returns the URL of an image captured from the live video stream. Requires that the camera is on and actively streaming. Use this field to get a snapshot from the live video stream. snapshot_url - returns the URL of an image captured from the live video stream Requires that the camera is on and actively streaming. The snapshot quality from the API is only 1080p throughput if you are: actively viewing the camera stream in the application (web_url). actively viewing the public stream (app_url). subscribed to Nest Aware. If you are not actively viewing the stream or do not have a Nest Aware subscription, the API has no 1080p source from which to retrieve a snapshot at that resolution and generates a lower-quality image. Also, low local network bandwidth may cause the API snapshot resolution to dip below 1080p with Nest Aware present. 	 0 	 1 	
GET 	 devices/cameras/device_id/last_event 	 This object captures information about the last event that triggered a notification. Some fields and some permission combinations require a Nest Aware subscription to access last event information. 	 0 	 1
