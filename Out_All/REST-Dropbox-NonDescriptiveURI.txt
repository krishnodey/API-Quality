POST 	 /file_properties/properties/overwrite 	 Overwrite property groups associated with a file. This endpoint should be used instead of properties/update when property groups are being updated via a "snapshot" instead of via a "delta".

POST 	 /file_properties/properties/update 	 Add, update or remove properties associated with the supplied file and templates. This endpoint should be used instead of properties/overwrite when property groups are being updated via a "delta" instead of via a "snapshot" .

POST 	 /files/copy_batch_v2 	 Copy multiple files or folders to different locations at once in the user's Dropbox. This route will replace copy_batch:1. The main difference is this route will return status for each entry, while copy_batch:1 raises failure if any entry fails. This route will either finish synchronously, or return a job ID and do the async copy job in background. Please use copy_batch/check:2 to check the job status. 	 0 	 1 	 Self-descriptive End-point
POST 	 /files/copy_batch/check_v2 	 Returns the status of an asynchronous job for copy_batch:2. It returns list of results for each entry. 	 0 	 1 	 Self-descriptive End-point
POST 	 /files/copy_reference/get 	 Get a copy reference to a file or folder. This reference string can be used to save that file or folder to another user's Dropbox by passing it to copy_reference/save. 	 0 	 1 	 Self-descriptive End-point
POST 	 /files/copy_reference/save 	 Save a copy reference returned by copy_reference/get to the user's Dropbox. 	 0 	 1 	 Self-descriptive End-point
POST 	 /files/create_folder_batch 	 Create multiple folders at once. This route is asynchronous for large batches, which returns a job ID immediately and runs the create folder batch asynchronously. Otherwise, creates the folders and returns the result synchronously for smaller inputs. You can force asynchronous behaviour by using the CreateFolderBatchArg.force_async flag. Use create_folder_batch/check to check the job status. 	 0 	 1 	 Self-descriptive End-point
POST 	 /files/create_folder_batch/check 	 Returns the status of an asynchronous job for create_folder_batch. If success, it returns list of result for each entry. 	 0 	 1 	 Self-descriptive End-point

POST 	 /files/download_zip 	 Download a folder from the user's Dropbox, as a zip file. The folder must be less than 20 GB in size and any single file within must be less than 4 GB in size. The resulting zip must have fewer than 10,000 total file and folder entries, including the top level folder. The input cannot be a single file. 	 0 	 1 	 Self-descriptive End-point
POST 	 /files/get_file_lock_batch 	 Return the lock metadata for the given list of paths. 	 0 	 1 	 Self-descriptive End-point
POST 	 /files/get_temporary_upload_link 	 Get a one-time use temporary upload link to upload a file to a Dropbox location. This endpoint acts as a delayed upload. The returned temporary upload link may be used to make a POST request with the data to be uploaded. The upload will then be perfomed with the CommitInfo previously provided to get_temporary_upload_link but evaluated only upon consumption. Hence, errors stemming from invalid CommitInfo with respect to the state of the user's Dropbox will only be communicated at consumption time. Additionally, these errors are surfaced as generic HTTP 409 Conflict responses, potentially hiding issue details. The maximum temporary upload link duration is 4 hours. Upon consumption or expiration, a new link will have to be generated. Multiple links may exist for a specific upload path at any given time. 	 0 	 1 	 Self-descriptive End-point
POST 	 /files/list_folder/get_latest_cursor 	 A way to quickly get a cursor for the folder's state. Unlike list_folder, list_folder/get_latest_cursor doesn't return any entries. This endpoint is for app which only needs to know about new files and modifications and doesn't need to know about files that already exist in Dropbox. 	 0 	 1 	 Self-descriptive End-point
POST 	 /files/move_batch/check_v2 	 Returns the status of an asynchronous job for move_batch:2. It returns list of results for each entry. 	 0 	 1 	 Self-descriptive End-point
POST 	 /files/save_url/check_job_status 	 Check the status of a save_url job. 	 0 	 1 	 Self-descriptive End-point
POST 	 /files/upload_session/append_v2 	 Append more data to an upload session. When the parameter close is set, this call will close the session. A single request should not upload more than 150 MB. The maximum size of a file one can upload to an upload session is 350 GB. Calls to this endpoint will count as data transport calls for any Dropbox Business teams with a limit on the number of data transport calls allowed per month. 	 0 	 1 	 Self-descriptive End-point
