post	 /bulk/devices/remove 	Inconsistent Documentation	Delete multiple devices. Delete multiple devices, each request can contain a maximum of 512 kB.
post	 /device/types/{typeId}/devices/{deviceId}/diag/logs 	Inconsistent Documentation	Add device diagnostic log information. Adds an entry in the log of diagnostic information for the device. If no date is supplied, the entry is added with the current date and time. The 10 most recent entries will be retained until either the device is deleted or the clear logs API is called.
post	 /device/types/{typeId}/devices/{deviceId}/diag/errorCodes 	Inconsistent Documentation	Add diagnostic error code for a device. Adds an error code to the list of error codes for the device. The 10 most recent entries will be retained until either the device is deleted or the clear error codes API is called.
delete	/device/types/{typeId}/devices/{deviceId}/diag/errorCodes	Inconsistent Documentation	Clear error codes. Clears the list of error codes for the device. The list is replaced with a single error code of zero.
get	/event/types	Inconsistent Documentation	Query active event types. Event types are used to model the events that are published to the Watson IoT Platform. An event type must be created in an organization before more complex processing can be performed on the native event. The /event/types endpoint returns the list of all of the active event types that have been defined for the organization in the Watson IoT Platform. Various query parameters can be used to filter, sort and page through the list of active event types that are returned.
