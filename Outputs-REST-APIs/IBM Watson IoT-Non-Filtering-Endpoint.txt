PUT	 /config/lec 	Non-Filtering Endpoint	Update the Last Event Cache configuration for your organization. Updates the current configuration for the Last Event Cache (LEC) feature for your organization. You can use this endpoint to control whether or not the LEC feature is currently enabled, along with how many days cached device events will persist for before being removed from the cache.
GET	 /s2s/services 	Non-Filtering Endpoint	Get all services. The services endpoint returns the list of all of the services that the Watson IoT Platform can connect to. The list can include a mixture of services that are either bound or unbound where: Bound services are services that the Watson IoT Platform has been configured to connect to. This can include other services in the same Bluemix space as the Watson IoT Platform or external services. Unbound services are other services in the same Bluemix space as the Watson IoT Platform service that the platform has not yet been configured to connect to. The Watson IoT Platform Dashboard UI must be used to bind to these services.
POST	 /s2s/services 	Non-Filtering Endpoint	Create a new service. Create a new external service. The service must include all of the details required to connect and authenticate to the external service in the credentials property. The structure of the credentials property will depend on the type of the target service.
GET	 /event/types 	Non-Filtering Endpoint	Query active event types. Event types are used to model the events that are published to the Watson IoT Platform. An event type must be created in an organization before more complex processing can be performed on the native event. The /event/types endpoint returns the list of all of the active event types that have been defined for the organization in the Watson IoT Platform. Various query parameters can be used to filter, sort and page through the list of active event types that are returned.
