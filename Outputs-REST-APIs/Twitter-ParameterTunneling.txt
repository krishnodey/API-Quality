GET	 /tweets/search/stream 	Parameter Tunneling	Streams Tweets in real-time based on a specific set of filter rules. If you are using the academic research product track, you can connect up to two redundant connections to maximize your streaming up-time.
GET	 /tweets/search/stream/rules 	Parameter Tunneling	Return a list of rules currently active on the streaming endpoint, either as a list or individually.
POST	 /tweets/search/stream/rules 	Parameter Tunneling	Add or delete rules to your stream. To create one or more rules, submit an add JSON body with an array of rules and operators. Similarly, to delete one or more rules, submit a delete JSON body with an array of list of existing rule IDs.

GET	 /users/by 	Parameter Tunneling	Returns a variety of information about one or more users specified by their usernames.
GET	 collections/entries 	Parameter Tunneling	Retrieve the identified Collection, presented as a list of the Tweets curated within. The response structure of this method differs significantly from timelines you may be used to working with elsewhere in the Twitter API. To navigate a Collection, use the position object of a response, which includes attributes for max_position, min_position, and was_truncated. was_truncated indicates whether additional Tweets exist in the collection outside of the range of the current request. To retrieve Tweets further back in time, use the value of min_position found in the current response as the max_position parameter in the next call to this endpoint.
GET	 collections/list 	Parameter Tunneling	Find Collections created by a specific user or containing a specific curated Tweet. Results are organized in a cursored collection.

GET	 statuses/user_timeline 	Parameter Tunneling	Returns a collection of the most recent Tweets posted by the user indicated by the screen_name or user_id parameters.
