POST	 /indices/search 	Structed Endpoint	The query search index.
PATCH	 /rules/ruleName 	Structed Endpoint	Replaces the rule. You must specify all parameters for the new rule. Creating rules is an administrator-level action. Any user who has permission to create rules will be able to access data processed by the rule.
POST	 /cacertificate	Structed Endpoint	Registers a CA certificate with AWS IoT. This CA certificate can then be used to sign device certificates, which can be then registered with AWS IoT. You can register up to 10 CA certificates per AWS account that have the same subject field. This enables you to have up to 10 certificate authorities sign your device certificates. If you have more than one CA certificate registered, make sure you pass the CA certificate when you register your device certificates with the RegisterCertificate API.

GET	 /audit/configuration 	Structed Endpoint	Gets information about the Device Defender audit settings for this account. Settings include how audit notifications are sent and which audit checks are enabled or disabled.
DELETE	 /thing-types/thingTypeName 	Structed Endpoint	Deletes the specified thing type. You cannot delete a thing type if it has things associated with it. To delete a thing type, first mark it as deprecated by calling DeprecateThingType, then remove any associated things by calling UpdateThing to change the thing type on any associated thing, and finally use DeleteThingType to delete the thing type.
DELETE	 /things/thingName	Structed Endpoint	Deletes the specified thing. Returns successfully with no error if the deletion is successful or you specify a thing that doesn't exist.
DELETE	 /provisioning-templates/templateName/versions/versionId 	Structed Endpoint	Deletes a fleet provisioning template version.

DELETE	 /policies/policyName/version/policyVersionId 	Structed Endpoint	Deletes the specified version of the specified policy. You cannot delete the default version of a policy using this API. To delete the default version of a policy, use DeletePolicy. To find out which version of a policy is marked as the default version, use ListPolicyVersions.
DELETE	 /policies/policyName 	Structed Endpoint	Deletes the specified policy. A policy cannot be deleted if it has non-default versions or it is attached to any certificate. To delete a policy, use the DeletePolicyVersion API to delete all non-default versions of the policy; use the DetachPrincipalPolicy API to detach the policy from any certificate; and then use the DeletePolicy API to delete the policy. When a policy is deleted using DeletePolicy, its default version is deleted with it.
DELETE	 /jobs/jobId	Structed Endpoint	Deletes a job and its related job executions. Deleting a job may take time, depending on the number of job executions created for the job and various other factors. While the job is being deleted, the status of the job will be shown as "DELETION_IN_PROGRESS". Attempting to delete or cancel a job whose status is already "DELETION_IN_PROGRESS" will result in an error. Only 10 jobs may have status "DELETION_IN_PROGRESS" at the same time, or a LimitExceededException will occur.
DELETE	 /certificates/certificateId	Structed Endpoint	Deletes the specified certificate. A certificate cannot be deleted if it has a policy or IoT thing attached to it or if its status is set to ACTIVE. To delete a certificate, first use the DetachPrincipalPolicy API to detach all policies. Next, use the UpdateCertificate API to set the certificate to the INACTIVE status.
POST	 /audit/suppressions/delete 	Structed Endpoint	Deletes a Device Defender audit suppression.
DELETE	 /audit/configuration	Structed Endpoint	Restores the default settings for Device Defender audits for this account. Any configuration data you entered is deleted and all audit checks are reset to disabled.
POST	 /destinations 	Structed Endpoint	Creates a topic rule destination. The destination must be confirmed prior to use.
POST	 /rules/ruleName 	Structed Endpoint	Creates a rule. Creating rules is an administrator-level action. Any user who has permission to create rules will be able to access data processed by the rule.
POST	 /things/thingName 	Structed Endpoint	Creates a thing record in the registry. If this call is made multiple times using the same thing name and configuration, the call will succeed. If this call is made with the same thing name but different configuration a ResourceAlreadyExistsException is thrown.
POST	 /streams/streamId 	Structed Endpoint	Creates a stream for delivering one or more large files in chunks over MQTT. A stream transports data bytes in chunks or blocks packaged as MQTT messages from a source like S3. You can have one or more files associated with a stream.
POST	 /provisioning-templates/templateName/versions	Structed Endpoint	Creates a new version of a fleet provisioning template.
POST	 /policies/policyName/version	Structed Endpoint	Creates a new version of the specified AWS IoT policy. To update a policy, create a new policy version. A managed policy can have up to five versions. If the policy has five versions, you must use DeletePolicyVersion to delete an existing version before you create a new one. Optionally, you can set the new version as the policy's default version. The default version is the operative version (that is, the version that is in effect for the certificates to which the policy is attached).
POST	 /policies/policyName 	Structed Endpoint	Creates an AWS IoT policy. The created policy is the default version for the policy. This operation creates a policy version with a version identifier of 1 and sets 1 as the policy's default version.
POST	 /mitigationactions/actions/actionName 	Structed Endpoint	Defines an action that can be applied to audit findings by using StartAuditMitigationActionsTask. Only certain types of mitigation actions can be applied to specific check names. For more information, see Mitigation actions. Each mitigation action can apply only one type of change.
POST	 /keys-and-certificate	Structed Endpoint	Creates a 2048-bit RSA key pair and issues an X.509 certificate using the issued public key. You can also call CreateKeysAndCertificate over MQTT from a device, for more information, see Provisioning MQTT API. This is the only time AWS IoT issues the private key for this certificate, so it is important to keep it in a secure location.
POST	 /dynamic-thing-groups/thingGroupName 	Structed Endpoint	Creates a dynamic thing group.
POST	 /dimensions/name 	Structed Endpoint	Create a dimension that you can use to limit the scope of a metric used in a security profile for AWS IoT Device Defender. For example, using a TOPIC_FILTER dimension, you can narrow down the scope of the metric only to MQTT topics whose name match the pattern specified in the dimension.
POST	 /certificates	Structed Endpoint	Creates an X.509 certificate using the specified certificate signing request. The CSR must include a public key that is either an RSA key with a length of at least 2048 bits or an ECC key from NIST P-256 or NIST P-384 curves. Reusing the same certificate signing request (CSR) results in a distinct certificate. You can create multiple certificates in a batch by creating a directory, copying multiple .csr files into that directory, and then specifying that directory on the command line. The following commands show how to create a batch of certificates given a batch of CSRs.
POST	 /billing-groups/billingGroupName 	Structed Endpoint	Creates a billing group.
POST	 /audit/suppressions/create 	Structed Endpoint	Creates a Device Defender audit suppression.
GET	 /confirmdestination/confirmationToken+ 	Structed Endpoint	Confirms a topic rule destination. When you create a rule requiring a destination, AWS IoT sends a confirmation message to the endpoint or base address you specify. The message includes a token which you pass back when calling ConfirmTopicRuleDestination to confirm that you own or have access to the endpoint.
DELETE	 /default-authorizer 	Structed Endpoint	Clears the default authorizer.
PUT	 /things/thingName/jobs/jobId/cancel	Structed Endpoint	Cancels the execution of a job for a given thing.
PUT	 /jobs/jobId/cancel	Structed Endpoint	Cancels a job.
PATCH	 /cancel-certificate-transfer/certificateId 	Structed Endpoint	Cancels a pending transfer for the specified certificate. Note Only the transfer source account can use this operation to cancel a transfer. (Transfer destinations can use RejectCertificateTransfer instead.) After transfer, AWS IoT returns the certificate to the source account in the INACTIVE state. After the destination account has accepted the transfer, the transfer cannot be cancelled. After a certificate transfer is cancelled, the status of the certificate changes from PENDING_TRANSFER to INACTIVE.
