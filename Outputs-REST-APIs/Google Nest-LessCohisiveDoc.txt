Count: 23
-/devices/thermostats/device_id/device_id	Pertinent Documentation	Nest Thermostat unique identifier.
-/devices/thermostats/device_id/locale	Pertinent Documentation	Specifies language and region (or country) preference.
-/devices/thermostats/device_id/software_version	Pertinent Documentation	Software version.
-/devices/thermostats/device_id/structure_id	Pertinent Documentation	Structure unique identifier.
-/devices/thermostats/device_id/name	Pertinent Documentation	Display name of the device. Can be any room name from a list we provide, or a custom name.
-/devices/thermostats/device_id/is_online	Pertinent Documentation	Device connection status with the Nest service.
-/devices/thermostats/device_id/can_cool	Pertinent Documentation	System ability to cool (has AC).
-/devices/thermostats/device_id/can_heat	Pertinent Documentation	System ability to heat.
-/devices/thermostats/device_id/is_using_emergency_heat	Pertinent Documentation	Emergency Heat status in systems with heat pumps for cooling. When Emergency Heat is on: The user can adjust the target temperature on the device, but cannot change the mode until Emergency Heat is turned off The hvac_mode can still be changed via the API
-/devices/thermostats/device_id/has_fan	Pertinent Documentation	System ability to control the fan independently from heating or cooling.
-/devices/thermostats/device_id/fan_timer_active	Pertinent Documentation	Indicates if the fan timer is engaged; used with fan_timer_duration to turn on the fan for a (user-specified) preset duration.
-/devices/thermostats/device_id/has_leaf	Pertinent Documentation	Displayed when the thermostat is set to an energy-saving temperature.
-/devices/thermostats/device_id/temperature_scale	Pertinent Documentation	Fahrenheit or Celsius; used with temperature display.
-/devices/thermostats/device_id/hvac_state	Pertinent Documentation	Indicates whether HVAC system is actively heating, cooling or is off. Use this value to indicate HVAC activity state. When off, the HVAC system is not actively heating or cooling. hvac_state is independent of fan operation.
-/devices/thermostats/device_id/is_locked	Pertinent Documentation	Thermostat Lock status. When true, the Thermostat Lock feature is enabled, and restricts the temperature range to these min/max values: locked_temp_min_f, locked_temp_max_f, locked_temp_min_c, and locked_temp_max_c.
-/devices/thermostats/device_id/sunlight_correction_enabled	Pertinent Documentation	Sunblock enabled status. Used with sunlight_correction_active. When true, Sunblock technology is enabled, and the Thermostat is automatically adjusting to direct sunlight, reading and setting the correct temperature.
-/devices/thermostats/device_id/where_name	Pertinent Documentation	The display name of the device. Associated with the Thermostat where_id. Can be any room name from a list we provide, or a custom name.
-/devices/thermostats/device_id/time_to_target_training	Pertinent Documentation	When in training mode, the Nest Thermostat learns about the HVAC system and discovers how much time it takes to reach the target temperature. When the Thermostat has enough information to make a reasonable estimate of the time to reach the target temperature, this value will change from training to ready.
-/devices/cameras/device_id/where_id	Pertinent Documentation	A unique, Nest-generated identifier that represents name, the display name of the device.
-/devices/cameras/device_id/activity_zones	Pertinent Documentation	Returns an array of all defined Activity Zones. Activity Zones are used to monitor motion events within user-defined areas of the video stream. Requires Nest Aware.
-/devices/cameras/device_id/snapshot_url	Pertinent Documentation	Capture an image on demand. Returns the URL of an image captured from the live video stream. Requires that the camera is on and actively streaming. Use this field to get a snapshot from the live video stream. snapshot_url - returns the URL of an image captured from the live video stream Requires that the camera is on and actively streaming. The snapshot quality from the API is only 1080p throughput if you are: actively viewing the camera stream in the application (web_url). actively viewing the public stream (app_url). subscribed to Nest Aware. If you are not actively viewing the stream or do not have a Nest Aware subscription, the API has no 1080p source from which to retrieve a snapshot at that resolution and generates a lower-quality image. Also, low local network bandwidth may cause the API snapshot resolution to dip below 1080p with Nest Aware present.
-devices/cameras/device_id/last_event	Pertinent Documentation	This object captures information about the last event that triggered a notification. Some fields and some permission combinations require a Nest Aware subscription to access last event information.
-/devices/cameras/device_id/last_event/has_sound	Pertinent Documentation	Sound event - sound was detected.
