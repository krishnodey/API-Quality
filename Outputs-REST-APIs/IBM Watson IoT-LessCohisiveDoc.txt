This can include other services in the same Bluemix space as the Watson IoT Platform or external services. Unbound services are other services in the same Bluemix space as the Watson IoT Platform service that the platform has not yet been configured to connect to. The Watson IoT Platform Dashboard UI must be used to bind to these services.
-/s2s/services	Pertinent Documentation	Create a new service. Create a new external service. The service must include all of the details required to connect and authenticate to the external service in the credentials property.

Please note the the delete will fail if the service is being referenced by another object in the organization, for example, a Historian Connector resource.
-/event/types	Pertinent Documentation	Query active event types. Event types are used to model the events that are published to the Watson IoT Platform. An event type must be created in an organization before more complex processing can be performed on the native event. The /event/types endpoint returns the list of all of the active event types that have been defined for the organization in the Watson IoT Platform. Various query parameters can be used to filter, sort and page through the list of active event types that are returned.
