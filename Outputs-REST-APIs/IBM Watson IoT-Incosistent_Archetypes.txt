Unbound services are other services in the same Bluemix space as the Watson IoT Platform service that the platform has not yet been configured to connect to. The Watson IoT Platform Dashboard UI must be used to bind to these services.

An event type must be created in an organization before more complex processing can be performed on the native event. The /event/types endpoint returns the list of all of the active event types that have been defined for the organization in the Watson IoT Platform. Various query parameters can be used to filter, sort and page through the list of active event types that are returned.
