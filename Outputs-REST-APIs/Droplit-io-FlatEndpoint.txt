GET	 /devices/:id/services 	Structed Endpoint	List the service properties of a device. List the service properties of a device. This endpoint lists the defined service properties of a device. Defined properties are those that have been assigned a value. If a device implements a service class, properties of that service class which are not set will not be returned. To list all properties of a device, including those that are not defined, get the properties of each service class implemented by the device. An account token, server token, or user token may be used to run this endpoint.
GET	 /devices/:id/services/:selector 	Structed Endpoint	Get a device service property. Get a device service property. This endpoint retrieves the specified service selector property from all devices in the environment on which the property is defined. All properties of a specific service class can be retrieved, by using the name of the service class as the path selector, or a specific property can be retrieved, by using the name of the service class followed by the property name. When specific property names are used, only one property can be retrieved at a time. For example, use ï¿½LightColorï¿½ to retrieve all properties of the LightColor service class, among all devices that implement that class. Use ï¿½LightColor.hueï¿½ to retrieve all values of LightColor.hue among the devices which implement it. Each property retrieved is contained in its own JSON object within the response array. If desired, the ï¿½refreshï¿½ parameter can be used to make sure that service selectors are specified properly. If this parameter is specified, the endpoint will explicitly reject service selectors that do not exist. By default, the endpoint ignores malformed service selectors, and in those cases returns an empty array of property information. An account token, server token, or user token may be used to run this endpoint.
PUT	 /devices/:id/services/:selector 	Structed Endpoint	Update Service Property. Call a device service method. An account token, server token, or user token may be used to run this endpoint. If there are any webhooks in the ecosystem listening for Set service notifications, their response, an example of which may be seen on the Webhooks v2 page, will include both the user's account type and ID.
PUT	 /devices/:id/services 	Structed Endpoint	Update Multiple Service Properties. Alter the service properties of a device. An account token, server token, or user token may be used to run this endpoint. If there are any webhooks in the ecosystem listening for Set service notifications, their response, an example of which may be seen on the Webhooks v2 page, will include both the user's account type and ID.
DELETE	 /devices/:id/services/:selector 	Structed Endpoint	Delete a device service property. Delete a device service property. This endpoint can delete an individual service property, or all the properties of a particular service. To delete a particular property, specify the selector as the fully qualified name of the property, as ï¿½SERVICE-NAME.PROPERTY.ï¿½ To delete all the properties associated with a service, specify the service name without attaching a property name. An account token, server token, or user token may be used to run this endpoint.
POST	 /devices/:id/services/:selector 	Structed Endpoint	Call Service Method. Call a device service method. An account token, server token, or user token may be used to run this endpoint.
