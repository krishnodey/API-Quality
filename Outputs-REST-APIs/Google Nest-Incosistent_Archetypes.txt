GET	 /devices/thermostats/device_id/time_to_target_training 	Plural Nouns Found in Consecutive Nodes	When in training mode, the Nest Thermostat learns about the HVAC system and discovers how much time it takes to reach the target temperature. When the Thermostat has enough information to make a reasonable estimate of the time to reach the target temperature, this value will change from training to ready.
GET	 /devices/cameras/device_id/where_id 	Plural Nouns Found in Consecutive Nodes	A unique, Nest-generated identifier that represents name, the display name of the device.
GET	 /devices/cameras/device_id/where_name 	Plural Nouns Found in Consecutive Nodes	The display name of the device. Associated with the Nest Cam where_id. Can be any room name from a list we provide, or a custom name.
GET	 /devices/cameras/device_id/is_public_share_enabled 	Plural Nouns Found in Consecutive Nodes	Users can choose to share their video and make it viewable by anyone. When public share is enabled, you can read public_share_url.
GET	 /devices/cameras/device_id/activity_zones 	Plural Nouns Found in Consecutive Nodes	Returns an array of all defined Activity Zones. Activity Zones are used to monitor motion events within user-defined areas of the video stream. Requires Nest Aware.
GET	 /devices/cameras/device_id/snapshot_url 	Plural Nouns Found in Consecutive Nodes	Capture an image on demand. Returns the URL of an image captured from the live video stream. Requires that the camera is on and actively streaming. Use this field to get a snapshot from the live video stream. snapshot_url - returns the URL of an image captured from the live video stream Requires that the camera is on and actively streaming. The snapshot quality from the API is only 1080p throughput if you are: actively viewing the camera stream in the application (web_url). actively viewing the public stream (app_url). subscribed to Nest Aware. If you are not actively viewing the stream or do not have a Nest Aware subscription, the API has no 1080p source from which to retrieve a snapshot at that resolution and generates a lower-quality image. Also, low local network bandwidth may cause the API snapshot resolution to dip below 1080p with Nest Aware present.
GET	 /devices/cameras/device_id/last_event/has_sound 	Plural Nouns Found in Consecutive Nodes	Sound event - sound was detected.
GET	 /devices/cameras/device_id/last_event/web_url 	Plural Nouns Found in Consecutive Nodes	Web URL (deep link) to the last sound or motion event at home.nest.com. Used to display the last recorded event, and requires user to be signed in to the account. Requires Nest Aware. If the event URL has expired or the device does not have an active subscription, then this value is not included in the payload.
