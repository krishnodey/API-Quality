GET	 /devices/thermostats/device_id/name 	Parameter Tunneling	Display name of the device. Can be any room name from a list we provide, or a custom name.
GET	 /devices/thermostats/device_id/name_long 	Parameter Tunneling	Long display name of the device. Includes a custom (label), created by the user, or via wheres.
GET	 /devices/thermostats/device_id/is_using_emergency_heat 	Parameter Tunneling	Emergency Heat status in systems with heat pumps for cooling. When Emergency Heat is on: The user can adjust the target temperature on the device, but cannot change the mode until Emergency Heat is turned off The hvac_mode can still be changed via the API
GET	 /devices/thermostats/device_id/where_name 	Parameter Tunneling	The display name of the device. Associated with the Thermostat where_id. Can be any room name from a list we provide, or a custom name.
GET	 /devices/thermostats/device_id/time_to_target_training 	Parameter Tunneling	When in training mode, the Nest Thermostat learns about the HVAC system and discovers how much time it takes to reach the target temperature. When the Thermostat has enough information to make a reasonable estimate of the time to reach the target temperature, this value will change from training to ready.
GET	 /devices/smoke_co_alarms/device_id/name 	Parameter Tunneling	Display name of the device; can be any room name from a list we provide, or a custom name.
GET	 /devices/smoke_co_alarms/device_id/where_name 	Parameter Tunneling	The display name of the device. Associated with the Nest Protect where_id. Can be any room name from a list we provide, or a custom name.
GET	 /devices/cameras/device_id/where_name 	Parameter Tunneling	The display name of the device. Associated with the Nest Cam where_id. Can be any room name from a list we provide, or a custom name.
GET	 /devices/cameras/device_id/activity_zones 	Parameter Tunneling	Returns an array of all defined Activity Zones. Activity Zones are used to monitor motion events within user-defined areas of the video stream. Requires Nest Aware.
GET	 /devices/cameras/device_id/snapshot_url 	Parameter Tunneling	Capture an image on demand. Returns the URL of an image captured from the live video stream. Requires that the camera is on and actively streaming. Use this field to get a snapshot from the live video stream. snapshot_url - returns the URL of an image captured from the live video stream Requires that the camera is on and actively streaming. The snapshot quality from the API is only 1080p throughput if you are: actively viewing the camera stream in the application (web_url). actively viewing the public stream (app_url). subscribed to Nest Aware. If you are not actively viewing the stream or do not have a Nest Aware subscription, the API has no 1080p source from which to retrieve a snapshot at that resolution and generates a lower-quality image. Also, low local network bandwidth may cause the API snapshot resolution to dip below 1080p with Nest Aware present.
