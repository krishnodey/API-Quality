GET	 /devices/thermostats/device_id/name 	Non-Filtering Endpoint	Display name of the device. Can be any room name from a list we provide, or a custom name.
GET	 /devices/thermostats/device_id/is_using_emergency_heat 	Non-Filtering Endpoint	Emergency Heat status in systems with heat pumps for cooling. When Emergency Heat is on: The user can adjust the target temperature on the device, but cannot change the mode until Emergency Heat is turned off The hvac_mode can still be changed via the API
GET	 /devices/thermostats/device_id/where_name 	Non-Filtering Endpoint	The display name of the device. Associated with the Thermostat where_id. Can be any room name from a list we provide, or a custom name.
GET	 /devices/thermostats/device_id/time_to_target_training 	Non-Filtering Endpoint	When in training mode, the Nest Thermostat learns about the HVAC system and discovers how much time it takes to reach the target temperature. When the Thermostat has enough information to make a reasonable estimate of the time to reach the target temperature, this value will change from training to ready.
GET	 /devices/smoke_co_alarms/device_id/name 	Non-Filtering Endpoint	Display name of the device; can be any room name from a list we provide, or a custom name.
GET	 /devices/smoke_co_alarms/device_id/where_name 	Non-Filtering Endpoint	The display name of the device. Associated with the Nest Protect where_id. Can be any room name from a list we provide, or a custom name.
GET	 /devices/cameras/device_id/where_name 	Non-Filtering Endpoint	The display name of the device. Associated with the Nest Cam where_id. Can be any room name from a list we provide, or a custom name.
GET	 /devices/cameras/device_id/activity_zones 	Non-Filtering Endpoint	Returns an array of all defined Activity Zones. Activity Zones are used to monitor motion events within user-defined areas of the video stream. Requires Nest Aware.
GET	 /devices/cameras/device_id/snapshot_url 	Non-Filtering Endpoint	Capture an image on demand. Returns the URL of an image captured from the live video stream. Requires that the camera is on and actively streaming. Use this field to get a snapshot from the live video stream. snapshot_url - returns the URL of an image captured from the live video stream Requires that the camera is on and actively streaming. The snapshot quality from the API is only 1080p throughput if you are: actively viewing the camera stream in the application (web_url). actively viewing the public stream (app_url). subscribed to Nest Aware. If you are not actively viewing the stream or do not have a Nest Aware subscription, the API has no 1080p source from which to retrieve a snapshot at that resolution and generates a lower-quality image. Also, low local network bandwidth may cause the API snapshot resolution to dip below 1080p with Nest Aware present.

GET	 /devices/thermostats/device_id/has_leaf 	Filtering Endpoint	Displayed when the thermostat is set to an energy-saving temperature.
POST	 /devices/thermostats/device_id/temperature_scale 	Filtering Endpoint	Fahrenheit or Celsius; used with temperature display.
POST	 /devices/thermostats/device_id/target_temperature_f 	Filtering Endpoint	Desired temperature, in full degrees Fahrenheit (1°F). Used when hvac_mode = heat or cool.
GET	 /devices/thermostats/device_id/eco_temperature_high_f 	Filtering Endpoint	Maximum Eco Temperature, displayed in whole degrees Fahrenheit (1°F). Used when hvac_mode = eco.
GET	 /devices/thermostats/device_id/eco_temperature_high_c 	Filtering Endpoint	Maximum Eco Temperature, displayed in half degrees Celsius (0.5°C). Used when hvac_mode = eco.
GET	 /devices/thermostats/device_id/hvac_state 	Filtering Endpoint	Indicates whether HVAC system is actively heating, cooling or is off. Use this value to indicate HVAC activity state. When off, the HVAC system is not actively heating or cooling. hvac_state is independent of fan operation.
