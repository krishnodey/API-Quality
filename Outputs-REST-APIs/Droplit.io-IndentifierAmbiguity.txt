GET	 /devices/:id/services 	[Identifier is Enclosed in {} or <> or Starts with :]	List the service properties of a device. List the service properties of a device. This endpoint lists the defined service properties of a device. Defined properties are those that have been assigned a value. If a device implements a service class, properties of that service class which are not set will not be returned. To list all properties of a device, including those that are not defined, get the properties of each service class implemented by the device. An account token, server token, or user token may be used to run this endpoint.
GET	 /devices/:id/services/:selector 	[Identifier is Enclosed in {} or <> or Starts with :]	Get a device service property. Get a device service property. This endpoint retrieves the specified service selector property from all devices in the environment on which the property is defined. All properties of a specific service class can be retrieved, by using the name of the service class as the path selector, or a specific property can be retrieved, by using the name of the service class followed by the property name. When specific property names are used, only one property can be retrieved at a time. For example, use ï¿½LightColorï¿½ to retrieve all properties of the LightColor service class, among all devices that implement that class. Use ï¿½LightColor.hueï¿½ to retrieve all values of LightColor.hue among the devices which implement it. Each property retrieved is contained in its own JSON object within the response array. If desired, the ï¿½refreshï¿½ parameter can be used to make sure that service selectors are specified properly. If this parameter is specified, the endpoint will explicitly reject service selectors that do not exist. By default, the endpoint ignores malformed service selectors, and in those cases returns an empty array of property information. An account token, server token, or user token may be used to run this endpoint.
