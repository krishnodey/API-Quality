POST	 /2/files/create_folder_batch 	Non-Filtering Endpoint	Create multiple folders at once. This route is asynchronous for large batches, which returns a job ID immediately and runs the create folder batch asynchronously. Otherwise, creates the folders and returns the result synchronously for smaller inputs. You can force asynchronous behaviour by using the CreateFolderBatchArg.force_async flag. Use create_folder_batch/check to check the job status.
POST	 /2/files/create_folder_batch/check 	Non-Filtering Endpoint	Returns the status of an asynchronous job for create_folder_batch. If success, it returns list of result for each entry.
POST	 /2/files/delete_v2 	Non-Filtering Endpoint	Delete the file or folder at a given path. If the path is a folder, all its contents will be deleted too. A successful response indicates that the file or folder was deleted. The returned metadata will be the corresponding FileMetadata or FolderMetadata for the item at time of deletion, and not a DeletedMetadata object.
POST	 /2/files/delete_batch 	Non-Filtering Endpoint	Delete multiple files/folders at once. This route is asynchronous, which returns a job ID immediately and runs the delete batch asynchronously. Use delete_batch/check to check the job status.
POST	 /2/files/delete_batch/check 	Non-Filtering Endpoint	Returns the status of an asynchronous job for delete_batch. If success, it returns list of result for each entry.
POST	 /2/files/download 	Non-Filtering Endpoint	Download a file from a user's Dropbox.

POST	 /2/files/get_file_lock_batch 	Non-Filtering Endpoint	Return the lock metadata for the given list of paths.
POST	 /2/files/get_metadata 	Non-Filtering Endpoint	Returns the metadata for a file or folder. Note: Metadata for the root folder is unsupported.
POST	 /2/files/get_preview 	Non-Filtering Endpoint	et a preview for a file. Currently, PDF previews are generated for files with the following extensions: .ai, .doc, .docm, .docx, .eps, .gdoc, .gslides, .odp, .odt, .pps, .ppsm, .ppsx, .ppt, .pptm, .pptx, .rtf. HTML previews are generated for files with the following extensions: .csv, .ods, .xls, .xlsm, .gsheet, .xlsx. Other formats will return an unsupported extension error.
POST	 /2/files/get_temporary_link 	Non-Filtering Endpoint	Get a temporary link to stream content of a file. This link will expire in four hours and afterwards you will get 410 Gone. This URL should not be used to display content directly in the browser. The Content-Type of the link is determined automatically by the file's mime type.
POST	 /2/files/get_temporary_upload_link 	Non-Filtering Endpoint	Get a one-time use temporary upload link to upload a file to a Dropbox location. This endpoint acts as a delayed upload. The returned temporary upload link may be used to make a POST request with the data to be uploaded. The upload will then be perfomed with the CommitInfo previously provided to get_temporary_upload_link but evaluated only upon consumption. Hence, errors stemming from invalid CommitInfo with respect to the state of the user's Dropbox will only be communicated at consumption time. Additionally, these errors are surfaced as generic HTTP 409 Conflict responses, potentially hiding issue details. The maximum temporary upload link duration is 4 hours. Upon consumption or expiration, a new link will have to be generated. Multiple links may exist for a specific upload path at any given time. The POST request on the temporary upload link must have its Content-Type set to "application/octet-stream". Example temporary upload link consumption request: curl -X POST https://content.dropboxapi.com/apitul/1/bNi2uIYF51cVBND --header "Content-Type: application/octet-stream" --data-binary @local_file.txt A successful temporary upload link consumption request returns the content hash of the uploaded data in JSON format. Example successful temporary upload link consumption response: {"content-hash": "599d71033d700ac892a0e48fa61b125d2f5994"} An unsuccessful temporary upload link consumption request returns any of the following status codes: HTTP 400 Bad Request: Content-Type is not one of application/octet-stream and text/plain or request is invalid. HTTP 409 Conflict: The temporary upload link does not exist or is currently unavailable, the upload failed, or another error happened. HTTP 410 Gone: The temporary upload link is expired or consumed. Example unsuccessful temporary upload link consumption response: Temporary upload link has been recently consumed.
POST	 /2/files/get_thumbnail_v2 	Non-Filtering Endpoint	Get a thumbnail for an image. This method currently supports files with the following file extensions: jpg, jpeg, png, tiff, tif, gif, webp, ppm and bmp. Photos that are larger than 20MB in size won't be converted to a thumbnail.
POST	 /2/files/get_thumbnail_batch 	Non-Filtering Endpoint	Get thumbnails for a list of images. We allow up to 25 thumbnails in a single batch. This method currently supports files with the following file extensions: jpg, jpeg, png, tiff, tif, gif, webp, ppm and bmp. Photos that are larger than 20MB in size won't be converted to a thumbnail.
POST	 /2/files/list_folder 	Non-Filtering Endpoint	Starts returning the contents of a folder. If the result's ListFolderResult.has_more field is true, call list_folder/continue with the returned ListFolderResult.cursor to retrieve more entries. If you're using ListFolderArg.recursive set to true to keep a local cache of the contents of a Dropbox account, iterate through each entry in order and process them as follows to keep your local state in sync: For each FileMetadata, store the new entry at the given path in your local state. If the required parent folders don't exist yet, create them. If there's already something else at the given path, replace it and remove all its children. For each FolderMetadata, store the new entry at the given path in your local state. If the required parent folders don't exist yet, create them. If there's already something else at the given path, replace it but leave the children as they are. Check the new entry's FolderSharingInfo.read_only and set all its children's read-only statuses to match. For each DeletedMetadata, if your local state has something at the given path, remove it and all its children. If there's nothing at the given path, ignore this entry. Note: auth.RateLimitError may be returned if multiple list_folder or list_folder/continue calls with same parameters are made simultaneously by same API app for same user. If your app implements retry logic, please hold off the retry until the previous request finishes.
POST	 /2/files/list_folder/continue 	Non-Filtering Endpoint	Once a cursor has been retrieved from list_folder, use this to paginate through all files and retrieve updates to the folder, following the same rules as documented for list_folder.
POST	 /2/files/list_folder/get_latest_cursor 	Non-Filtering Endpoint	A way to quickly get a cursor for the folder's state. Unlike list_folder, list_folder/get_latest_cursor doesn't return any entries. This endpoint is for app which only needs to know about new files and modifications and doesn't need to know about files that already exist in Dropbox.
POST	 /2/files/list_folder/longpoll 	Non-Filtering Endpoint	A longpoll endpoint to wait for changes on an account. In conjunction with list_folder/continue, this call gives you a low-latency way to monitor an account for file changes. The connection will block until there are changes available or a timeout occurs. This endpoint is useful mostly for client-side apps. If you're looking for server-side notifications, check out our webhooks documentation.
POST	 /2/files/list_revisions 	Non-Filtering Endpoint	Returns revisions for files based on a file path or a file id. The file path or file id is identified from the latest file entry at the given file path or id. This end point allows your app to query either by file path or file id by setting the mode parameter appropriately. In the ListRevisionsMode.path (default) mode, all revisions at the same file path as the latest file entry are returned. If revisions with the same file id are desired, then mode must be set to ListRevisionsMode.id. The ListRevisionsMode.id mode is useful to retrieve revisions for a given file across moves or renames.
POST	 /2/files/lock_file_batch 	Non-Filtering Endpoint	Lock the files at the given paths. A locked file will be writable only by the lock holder. A successful response indicates that the file has been locked. Returns a list of the locked file paths and their metadata after this operation.
POST	 /2/files/move_v2 	Non-Filtering Endpoint	Move a file or folder to a different location in the user's Dropbox. If the source path is a folder all its contents will be moved. Note that we do not currently support case-only renaming.
POST	 /2/files/move_batch_v2 	Non-Filtering Endpoint	Move multiple files or folders to different locations at once in the user's Dropbox. Note that we do not currently support case-only renaming. This route will replace move_batch:1. The main difference is this route will return status for each entry, while move_batch:1 raises failure if any entry fails. This route will either finish synchronously, or return a job ID and do the async move job in background. Please use move_batch/check:2 to check the job status.
POST	 /2/files/move_batch/check_v2 	Non-Filtering Endpoint	Returns the status of an asynchronous job for move_batch:2. It returns list of results for each entry.
POST	 /2/files/paper/create 	Non-Filtering Endpoint	Creates a new Paper doc with the provided content.
POST	 /2/files/paper/update 	Non-Filtering Endpoint	Updates an existing Paper doc with the provided content.
POST	 /2/files/permanently_delete 	Non-Filtering Endpoint	Permanently delete the file or folder at a given path (see https://www.dropbox.com/en/help/40). If the given file or folder is not yet deleted, this route will first delete it. It is possible for this route to successfully delete, then fail to permanently delete. Note: This endpoint is only available for Dropbox Business apps.
POST	 /2/files/restore 	Non-Filtering Endpoint	Restore a specific revision of a file to the given path.
POST	 /2/files/save_url 	Non-Filtering Endpoint	Save the data from a specified URL into a file in user's Dropbox. Note that the transfer from the URL must complete within 15 minutes, or the operation will time out and the job will fail. If the given path already exists, the file will be renamed to avoid the conflict (e.g. myfile (1).txt).
POST	 /2/files/save_url/check_job_status 	Non-Filtering Endpoint	Check the status of a save_url job.
POST	 /2/files/search_v2 	Non-Filtering Endpoint	Searches for files and folders. Note: search:2 along with search/continue:2 can only be used to retrieve a maximum of 10,000 matches. Recent changes may not immediately be reflected in search results due to a short delay in indexing. Duplicate results may be returned across pages. Some results may not be returned.
POST	 /2/files/search/continue_v2 	Non-Filtering Endpoint	Fetches the next page of search results returned from search:2. Note: search:2 along with search/continue:2 can only be used to retrieve a maximum of 10,000 matches. Recent changes may not immediately be reflected in search results due to a short delay in indexing. Duplicate results may be returned across pages. Some results may not be returned.
POST	 /2/files/tags/add 	Non-Filtering Endpoint	Add a tag to an item. A tag is a string. The strings are automatically converted to lowercase letters. No more than 20 tags can be added to a given item.

A successful response indicates that the file has been unlocked. Returns a list of the unlocked file paths and their metadata after this operation.
POST	 /2/files/upload 	Non-Filtering Endpoint	Create a new file with the contents provided in the request. Do not use this to upload a file larger than 150 MB. Instead, create an upload session with upload_session/start. Calls to this endpoint will count as data transport calls for any Dropbox Business teams with a limit on the number of data transport calls allowed per month. For more information, see the Data transport limit page.
POST	 /2/files/upload_session/append_v2 	Non-Filtering Endpoint	Append more data to an upload session. When the parameter close is set, this call will close the session. A single request should not upload more than 150 MB. The maximum size of a file one can upload to an upload session is 350 GB. Calls to this endpoint will count as data transport calls for any Dropbox Business teams with a limit on the number of data transport calls allowed per month. For more information, see the Data transport limit page.
POST	 /2/files/upload_session/finish 	Non-Filtering Endpoint	Finish an upload session and save the uploaded data to the given file path. A single request should not upload more than 150 MB. The maximum size of a file one can upload to an upload session is 350 GB. Calls to this endpoint will count as data transport calls for any Dropbox Business teams with a limit on the number of data transport calls allowed per month. For more information, see the Data transport limit page.
POST	 /2/files/upload_session/finish_batch_v2 	Non-Filtering Endpoint	This route helps you commit many files at once into a user's Dropbox. Use upload_session/start and upload_session/append:2 to upload file contents. We recommend uploading many files in parallel to increase throughput. Once the file contents have been uploaded, rather than calling upload_session/finish, use this route to finish all your upload sessions in a single request. UploadSessionStartArg.close or UploadSessionAppendArg.close needs to be true for the last upload_session/start or upload_session/append:2 call of each upload session. The maximum size of a file one can upload to an upload session is 350 GB. We allow up to 1000 entries in a single request. Calls to this endpoint will count as data transport calls for any Dropbox Business teams with a limit on the number of data transport calls allowed per month. For more information, see the Data transport limit page.
POST	 /2/files/upload_session/finish_batch/check 	Non-Filtering Endpoint	Returns the status of an asynchronous job for upload_session/finish_batch. If success, it returns list of result for each entry.
POST	 /2/files/upload_session/start 	Non-Filtering Endpoint	Upload sessions allow you to upload a single file in one or more requests, for example where the size of the file is greater than 150 MB. This call starts a new upload session with the given data. You can then use upload_session/append:2 to add more data and upload_session/finish to save all the data to a file in Dropbox. A single request should not upload more than 150 MB. The maximum size of a file one can upload to an upload session is 350 GB. An upload session can be used for a maximum of 7 days. Attempting to use an UploadSessionStartResult.session_id with upload_session/append:2 or upload_session/finish more than 7 days after its creation will return a UploadSessionLookupError.not_found. Calls to this endpoint will count as data transport calls for any Dropbox Business teams with a limit on the number of data transport calls allowed per month. For more information, see the Data transport limit page. By default, upload sessions require you to send content of the file in sequential order via consecutive upload_session/start, upload_session/append:2, upload_session/finish calls. For better performance, you can instead optionally use a UploadSessionType.concurrent upload session. To start a new concurrent session, set UploadSessionStartArg.session_type to UploadSessionType.concurrent. After that, you can send file data in concurrent upload_session/append:2 requests. Finally finish the session with upload_session/finish. There are couple of constraints with concurrent sessions to make them work. You can not send data with upload_session/start or upload_session/finish call, only with upload_session/append:2 call. Also data uploaded in upload_session/append:2 call must be multiple of 4194304 bytes (except for last upload_session/append:2 with UploadSessionStartArg.close to true, that may contain any remaining data).
POST	 /2/files/upload_session/start_batch 	Non-Filtering Endpoint	This route starts batch of upload_sessions. Please refer to `upload_session/start` usage. Calls to this endpoint will count as data transport calls for any Dropbox Business teams with a limit on the number of data transport calls allowed per month. For more information, see the Data transport limit page.
