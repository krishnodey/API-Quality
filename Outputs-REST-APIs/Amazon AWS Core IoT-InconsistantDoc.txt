You can use filters to list only those security profiles associated with a thing group or only those associated with your account.
GET	/billing-groups?maxResults=maxResults&namePrefixFilter=namePrefixFilter&nextToken=nextToken	Inconsistent Documentation	Lists the billing groups you have created.
POST	 /audit/suppressions/list 	Inconsistent Documentation	Lists your Device Defender audit listings.
POST	 /audit/findings 	Inconsistent Documentation	Lists the findings (results) of a Device Defender audit or of the audits performed during a specified time period. (Findings are retained for 90 days.)
POST	 /indices/statistics 	Inconsistent Documentation	Returns the count, average, sum, minimum, maximum, sum of squares, variance, and standard deviation for the specified aggregated field. If the aggregation field is of type String, only the count statistic is returned.
POST	 /indices/percentiles 	Inconsistent Documentation	Groups the aggregated values that match the query into percentile groupings. The default percentile groupings are: 1,5,25,50,75,95,99, although you can specify your own when you call GetPercentiles. This function returns a value for each percentile group specified (or the default percentile groupings). The percentile group "1" contains the aggregated field value that occurs in approximately one percent of the values that match the query. The percentile group "5" contains the aggregated field value that occurs in approximately five percent of the values that match the query, and so on. The result is an approximation, the more values that match the query, the more accurate the percentile values.
POST	 /effective-policies?thingName=thingName 	Inconsistent Documentation	Gets a list of the policies that have an effect on the authorization behavior of the specified device when it connects to the AWS IoT device gateway.

DELETE	/audit/configuration?deleteScheduledAudits=deleteScheduledAudits	Inconsistent Documentation	Restores the default settings for Device Defender audits for this account. Any configuration data you entered is deleted and all audit checks are reset to disabled.
POST	 /policies/policyName/version?setAsDefault=setAsDefault 	Inconsistent Documentation	Creates a new version of the specified AWS IoT policy. To update a policy, create a new policy version. A managed policy can have up to five versions. If the policy has five versions, you must use DeletePolicyVersion to delete an existing version before you create a new one. Optionally, you can set the new version as the policy's default version. The default version is the operative version (that is, the version that is in effect for the certificates to which the policy is attached).
POST	 /mitigationactions/actions/actionName 	Inconsistent Documentation	Defines an action that can be applied to audit findings by using StartAuditMitigationActionsTask. Only certain types of mitigation actions can be applied to specific check names. For more information, see Mitigation actions. Each mitigation action can apply only one type of change.

When you create a rule requiring a destination, AWS IoT sends a confirmation message to the endpoint or base address you specify. The message includes a token which you pass back when calling ConfirmTopicRuleDestination to confirm that you own or have access to the endpoint.

DELETE	/thing-types/thingTypeName	Consistent Documentation	Deletes the specified thing type. You cannot delete a thing type if it has things associated with it.

To delete a policy, use the DeletePolicyVersion API to delete all non-default versions of the policy; use the DetachPrincipalPolicy API to detach the policy from any certificate; and then use the DeletePolicy API to delete the policy. When a policy is deleted using DeletePolicy, its default version is deleted with it.
DELETE	/jobs/jobId?force=force&namespaceId=namespaceId	Consistent Documentation	Deletes a job and its related job executions. Deleting a job may take time, depending on the number of job executions created for the job and various other factors. While the job is being deleted, the status of the job will be shown as "DELETION_IN_PROGRESS". Attempting to delete or cancel a job whose status is already "DELETION_IN_PROGRESS" will result in an error. Only 10 jobs may have status "DELETION_IN_PROGRESS" at the same time, or a LimitExceededException will occur.

If this call is made with the same thing name but different configuration a ResourceAlreadyExistsException is thrown.

POST	 /provisioning-templates/templateName/versions?setAsDefault=setAsDefault 	Consistent Documentation	Creates a new version of a fleet provisioning template.
POST	 /policies/policyName 	Consistent Documentation	Creates an AWS IoT policy. The created policy is the default version for the policy. This operation creates a policy version with a version identifier of 1 and sets 1 as the policy's default version.
POST	 /keys-and-certificate?setAsActive=setAsActive 	Consistent Documentation	Creates a 2048-bit RSA key pair and issues an X.509 certificate using the issued public key. You can also call CreateKeysAndCertificate over MQTT from a device, for more information, see Provisioning MQTT API. This is the only time AWS IoT issues the private key for this certificate, so it is important to keep it in a secure location.
POST	 /dynamic-thing-groups/thingGroupName 	Consistent Documentation	Creates a dynamic thing group.
POST	 /dimensions/name 	Consistent Documentation	Create a dimension that you can use to limit the scope of a metric used in a security profile for AWS IoT Device Defender. For example, using a TOPIC_FILTER dimension, you can narrow down the scope of the metric only to MQTT topics whose name match the pattern specified in the dimension.
POST	 /certificates?setAsActive=setAsActive 	Consistent Documentation	Creates an X.509 certificate using the specified certificate signing request. The CSR must include a public key that is either an RSA key with a length of at least 2048 bits or an ECC key from NIST P-256 or NIST P-384 curves. Reusing the same certificate signing request (CSR) results in a distinct certificate. You can create multiple certificates in a batch by creating a directory, copying multiple .csr files into that directory, and then specifying that directory on the command line. The following commands show how to create a batch of certificates given a batch of CSRs.
POST	 /billing-groups/billingGroupName 	Consistent Documentation	Creates a billing group.
POST	 /audit/suppressions/create 	Consistent Documentation	Creates a Device Defender audit suppression.
DELETE	/default-authorizer	Consistent Documentation	Clears the default authorizer.
PUT	 /things/thingName/jobs/jobId/cancel?force=force 	Consistent Documentation	Cancels the execution of a job for a given thing.
PUT	 /jobs/jobId/cancel?force=force 	Consistent Documentation	Cancels a job.
PATCH	/cancel-certificate-transfer/certificateId	Consistent Documentation	Cancels a pending transfer for the specified certificate. Note Only the transfer source account can use this operation to cancel a transfer. (Transfer destinations can use RejectCertificateTransfer instead.) After transfer, AWS IoT returns the certificate to the source account in the INACTIVE state. After the destination account has accepted the transfer, the transfer cannot be cancelled. After a certificate transfer is cancelled, the status of the certificate changes from PENDING_TRANSFER to INACTIVE.
