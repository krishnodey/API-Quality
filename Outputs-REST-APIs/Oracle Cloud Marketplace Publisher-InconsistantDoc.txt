post	 /applications/{listingVersionId}/icon 	Inconsistent Documentation	Upload an icon for the application listing. The icon dimensions must be 130 X 130 px. The following extensions are allowed: png, jpg.
post	 /applications/{listingVersionId}/version 	Inconsistent Documentation	Create a new version for an already published application listing. A new version is necessary to make edits to an already published listing.The new version has to go though the same life cycle and approval workflow to get published to the Marketplace. Publishing the new version automatically archives the older version from the Marketplace. At any given point only one version of the application is active on the Marketplace.
put	 /applications/{listingVersionId} 	Inconsistent Documentation	Update the Application listing. Only applications in a NEW or REJECTED state can be updated. To update a listing that is published, a new version of the listing must be created.
put	 /applications/{listingVersionId}/packages/{packageVersionId} 	Inconsistent Documentation	Update the specified package. If the package was validated it will need to be validated again after the update.Packages of an already published listing cannot be updated.
put	 /applications/{listingVersionId}/recommendedservices 	Inconsistent Documentation	Creates a list of recommended service integrators for an application with specified id. If the call is made with an empty list, it clears the entire existing list of recommended services associated with this application, if any.
