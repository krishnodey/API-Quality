This is IMHO pretty misleading when this survey aims at REST and RESTfulness. Also the question with the empty bearer token was odd to me. Since the screenshot did not require any auth, none of the answers looked correct to me. I would have expected a 401 if the bearer token is empty or wrong."

I've been taught that it is dangerous to read to deep into an URL, yet it was the only source of information. So basically that's the reason I rated all APIs bad to understand. Those with more parameters had more context, so it was easier to understand. I would have preferred this context to be given by description instead of parameters. So if you interpret my ratings you could come to the conclusion that I think: Parameters - the more the merrier! That's actually not the case. However context (almost always) helps. Also the one question with the ""delete queue"" and the GET request: I have no clue what it does. I just hope that it doesn't actually delete the queue instead. As it shouldn't, it's a GET, isn't it? Well, it's not that I've not seen APIs delete stuff on a GET request. I host HOPE it's not what it does. Would I rely on it: Probably not… Good luck for the further studies and don't read too much into API endpoints! ;-)"
