To start a new concurrent session, set UploadSessionStartArg.session_type to UploadSessionType.concurrent. After that, you can send file data in concurrent upload_session/append:2 requests. Finally finish the session with upload_session/finish. There are couple of constraints with concurrent sessions to make them work. You can not send data with upload_session/start or upload_session/finish call, only with upload_session/append:2 call.

1679,REST,Sonos,POST , /groups/{groupId}/groupVolume ," Use the setVolume command in the groupVolume namespace to set group volume to a specific level and unmute the group if muted. When your app sets the group volume, the group coordinator calculates the required changes to the volume level for each player in the group so that the result is the average volume level of the group as a whole. The group coordinator then adjusts its local volume and initiates network transactions with the other players in the group to adjust their volumes accordingly. While players adjust their volumes, the group coordinator may generate one or more groupVolume events. Since this command can generate additional network transactions and events, your app should optimize how often it is invoked to maintain a good user experience without flooding the network, such as when implementing a touch screen volume slider that controls a group of five players.

Your app can use setRelativeVolume instead of setVolume when the user intent is to increase or decrease the group volume, but not to set the final volume to a particular value. For example, your app should use setRelativeVolume when the user presses hard volume plus/minus buttons on a mobile device. The group will automatically limit the final volume set within the valid range, so your app does not need to worry about that.

1681,REST,Sonos,POST , /groups/{groupId}/groupVolume/mute ," Use the setMute command in the groupVolume namespace to mute and unmute the group. The group’s mute state is independent of its group volume. For example a group’s mute state can be true although its group volume is still 20, and the user will not hear any audio coming from the group of players. Individual player volume values are stored by each player in the group while muted, which allows the group to retain the relative volume of players in the group. That is important information to preserve, since users may have carefully configured the individual player volumes in the group with a Sonos controller. Your app should not mute the group by calling setVolume with zero volume, otherwise the relative volume of players in the group will be lost. If some players in the group are muted and others are not, calling setMute to mute the group will mute all the players in the group. The individual player’s mute state prior to calling setMute is not preserved. To get the current group’s mute state, use the getVolume command or subscribe to the groupVolume event.

This command requires your app to have either created a new session or joined an existing session, and also loaded a cloud queue on the group with loadCloudQueue. Use playOnCompletion to start playing the cloud queue item being loaded, so your app doesn’t have to send an extra play command. Most of the times your app already has access to the track metadata of the cloud queue item that is being loaded. Use the optional trackMetadata parameter to provide that information so the group can start playing the track immediately after receiving the loadCloudQueue command. This optimization improves the user experience by starting playback before the player fetches tracks from the cloud queue server.

See the Cloud Queue API /itemWindow endpoint for details. This command requires your app to have either created a new session or joined an existing session, and also loaded a cloud queue on the group with loadCloudQueue. Your app should only use this command when it detects a change in the cloud queue content that should immediately be reflected in the group. For example, if a user removes the currently playing track with your app, use this command to remove the track from the group and stop it from playing. This helps provide a good user experience.

If there is no current session and no other source is playing, joinOrCreateSession creates a new session and joins it. While this same behavior can be achieved by first calling joinSession and then conditionally calling createSession, using joinOrCreateSession guarantees that another app cannot create a session in between the two commands. Use appContext to determine how multiple instances of your app can share control of a session. For example, if you provide a user account identifier as appContext, then two instances of your app logged into the same user account would be able to control the same session on a group. If you choose to implement your app to always provide an appContext that is unique for all app instances, then only one app instance can control a session at any time. Use customData to save information in the session that your app finds useful. For example, your app could store a playlist identifier in customData, so that another app instance could automatically load the right playlist when joining a session.
